# INST-126-Final
README.md
# I am going to make a program that scrapes data from a wikipedia website and then using pandas, creates a dataframe. 
# I found a table on wikipedia I could scrape, and then I am going to import pandas and turn it into a data frame
# Because it is a pretty big data frame, then I am going to trim the data so it only shows the presidents names, birth/death year, and their terms in which they served. 
# first import bs4 as beautiful soup, this will be used for web scraping
# import pandas as pd to make the dataframe and use the df command to do so
# the license used was the basic MIT software license because you are able to copy and reuse the work. It is one of the most common licenses used in programming.
